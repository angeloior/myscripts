1.9. Extending a logical volume

 To extend a logical volume you simply tell the lvextend command how much you want to increase the size. You can specify how much to grow the volume, or how large you want it to grow to: 
# lvextend -L12G /dev/myvg/homevol
lvextend -- extending logical volume "/dev/myvg/homevol" to 12 GB
lvextend -- doing automatic backup of volume group "myvg"
lvextend -- logical volume "/dev/myvg/homevol" successfully extended
        

 will extend /dev/myvg/homevol to 12 Gigabytes. 


# lvextend -L+1G /dev/myvg/homevol
lvextend -- extending logical volume "/dev/myvg/homevol" to 13 GB
lvextend -- doing automatic backup of volume group "myvg"
lvextend -- logical volume "/dev/myvg/homevol" successfully extended
        

 will add another gigabyte to /dev/myvg/homevol. 


 After you have extended the logical volume it is necessary to increase the file system size to match. how you do this depends on the file system you are using. 

 By default, most file system resizing tools will increase the size of the file system to be the size of the underlying logical volume so you don't need to worry about specifying the same size for each of the two commands. 



 ext2/ext3 

 Unless you have patched your kernel with the ext2online patch it is necessary to unmount the file system before resizing it. (It seems that the online resizing patch is rather dangerous, so use at your own risk) 
   # umount /dev/myvg/homevol/dev/myvg/homevol
   # resize2fs /dev/myvg/homevol
   # mount /dev/myvg/homevol /home
