11.8. Removing a logical volume


 A logical volume must be closed before it can be removed:

# umount /dev/myvg/homevol
# lvremove /dev/myvg/homevol
lvremove -- do you really want to remove "/dev/myvg/homevol"? [y/n]: y
lvremove -- doing automatic backup of volume group "myvg"
lvremove -- logical volume "/dev/myvg/homevol" successfully removed
