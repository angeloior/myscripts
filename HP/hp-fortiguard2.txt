HP Service Guard Cluster
How to setup a Two-Node cluster:

1. Modify /etc/hosts on both the nodes to include stationary and heartbeat IP addresses.

2. Create volume groups, logical volumes, filesystems on the first node and then import on the second node

3. Configure /.rhosts & /etc/cmcluster/cmclnodelist on both the nodes
Example:
/.rhosts
node1 root
node2 root

/etc/cmcluster/cmclnodelist
node1 root
node2 root

4. Configure stationary and heartbeat IP addresses on both the nodes

    a. Modify /etc/rc.config.d/netconf
    b. /sbin/init.d/net stop
    c. /sbin/init.d/net start

5. Modify /etc/lvmrc to disable auto-activation of volume groups

6. Create the cluster configuration file on the first node
# cmquerycl -v -C /etc/cmcluster/mycluster.conf -n node1 -n node2


7. Modify the configuration file include your needs

8. Verify the configuration file

# cmcheckconf -v -C /etc/clcluster/mycluster.conf

9. Create the cluster binary file and distribute to all the nodes across the cluster
# cmapplyconf -v -C /etc/clcluster/mycluster.conf

10. To view the cluster configuration
# cmviewcl -v

11. Start the cluster
# cmruncl -v

12. Halt the cluster
# cmhaltcl -v

13. You're done.

Execution sequence for starting a package :

1. Master control script
2. External pre-scripts
3. Volume Groups
4. File Systems
5. Package IPs
6. External Scripts
7. Services


Frequently used commands :

To start the entire cluster : # cmruncl –v

To stop the entire cluster : # cmhaltcl

To view the status of cluster : # cmviewcl

To view the cluster, node, package status : # cmviewcl -v

To start a node in the cluster : # cmrunnode -v nodename

To stop a node in the cluster : # cmhaltnode -f -v nodename

To see the configuration : # cmgetconf -C config_name

To start a package : # cmrunpkg pkg1

To start a package on a node : # cmrunpkg -n ndoename pkg1

To halt a package : # cmhaltpkg pkg1


Configuration Files :-

/etc/cmcluster/cmclnodelist – Contains the list of nodes in the cluster 

/etc/cmcluster/cluster_config.ascii - cluster configuration file. 

/etc/cmcluster/package_name/package_config.ascii - package configuration file

/etc/cmcluster/package_name/package.cntl - package control script
