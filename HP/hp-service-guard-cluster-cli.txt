6)Managing Packages and Services:

Starting a Package:

Use the cmrunpkg command to run the package on a particular node, then use the cmmodpkg command to enable switching for the package. For example, to start a failover package:
cmrunpkg -n nodename package_name
cmrunpkg -n umhpux9 pkg1
cmmodpkg -e pkg1
This starts up the package on umhpux9, then enables package switching.

This sequence is necessary when a package has previously been halted on some node, since halting the package disables switching.
Halting a Package:

Use the cmhaltpkg command to halt a package, as follows:
cmhaltpkg package_name
cmhaltpkg pkg1
This halts pkg1, and, if pkg1 is a failover package, also disables it from switching to another node.

You cannot halt a package unless all packages that depend on it are down.
