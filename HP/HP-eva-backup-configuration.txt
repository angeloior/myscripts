locate the SSSU.exe file on your SMA or SMS

step 1:
SELECT MANAGER manager name USERNAME=username PASSWORD= 

eg: SELECT MANAGER 192.168.1.55 USERNAME=administrator
PASSWORD:

The SELECT MANAGER command configures the utility for use on the specified
HP Command View EVA instance. The manager name can be a management server
name or an IP address. The user name and password are the account
credentials that were created for you during HP Command View EVA
installation. The user name and password are validated in the background on
every command.

step 2:

SELECT SYSTEM system name
eg: SELECT SYSTEM myEVA

you can always do a LS SYSTEM before this step if you don't know your array
name.

The SELECT SYSTEM command directs the command prompt to the selected array.
All configuration commands affect the selected array. If the system name
includes spaces, enclose it in quotes

step 3:
CAPTURE CONFIGURATION file name
eg: CAPTURE CONFIGURATION c:\myconfig.txt

The CAPTURE CONFIGURATION command enables you to capture, save, and
re-create an array configuration by querying the selected array and
generating up to five scripts. 

it will generate your config file wich can be restore if you suffer a
catastrophic failure.
