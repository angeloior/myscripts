Set up the serial connection
Use a null modem cable to connect the two nodes through their serial ports. Now test the serial connection, as follows:
On ha1 (receiver), type:
cat < /dev/ttyS0
On ha2 (sender) type:
echo "Serial Connection test" > /dev/ttyS0
You should see the text on the receiver node (ha1). If it works, change their roles and try again.
