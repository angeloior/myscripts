Split-Brain detected, dropping connection!
After split brain has been detected, one node will always have the resource in a StandAlone connection state. The other might either also be in the StandAlone state (if both nodes detected the split brain simultaneously), or in WFConnection (if the peer tore down the connection before the other node had a chance to detect split brain).

At this point, unless you configured DRBD to automatically recover from split brain, you must manually intervene by selecting one node whose modifications will 
be discarded (this node is referred to as the split brain victim). This intervention is made with the following commands:

drbdadm secondary home
drbdadm -- --discard-my-data connect home
On the other node (the split brain survivor), if its connection state is also StandAlone, you would enter:

drbdadm connect home
