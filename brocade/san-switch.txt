I finally got it working using the latest version of Java 8 u 101.
 
I performed 3 steps to get the WT up and running from my windows 10 PC.
 
1. Edit the java.security file
      - Go to Java/jre1.8.0_101(in my case)/lib/security
      - Open java.security file using notepad to edit it
      - Search for: jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms=MD2, MD5, RSA keySize < 1024
      - Replace the 1024 for 256. It should look like this: jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms=MD2, MD5, RSA
        keySize < 256
      - Save it
 
2. Configure Java Security
      - Go to Configure Java
      - Under the Security Tab go to Edit List and add the name or IP that the switch is configured with.
      - Click OK
 
3. Point Java to use a different Java Runtime Environment (I recommend javaw.exe version 1.6)
      - Copy the jre6 folder under the c:\Program Files (x86)\Java (I can provide a zip file of this folder upon
        request)
      - Go to Configure Java and under the Java Tab click View
      - Click Add and add a new Path: C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre6\\bin\javaw.exe (This force java to
        use the old RE without installing an old version.
      - Uncheck 1.8 (newer version)
      - Click OK
 
Now, give it a try and you will be thrilled with the results. Just a heads up, once you try opening the WT
again you will be prompted if you would like to use the old RE, make sure you use the old one. 
 
This is what i did in order to keep the latest installaion of Java.
