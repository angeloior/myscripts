General-purpose storage accounts
There are two kinds of general-purpose storage accounts.

Standard storage
The most widely used storage accounts are standard storage accounts, which can be used for all types of data. Standard storage accounts use magnetic media to store data.
1 
Premium storage
Premium storage provides high-performance storage for page blobs, which are primarily used for VHD files. Premium storage accounts use SSD to store data. Microsoft recommends using Premium Storage for all of your VMs.

Blob Storage accounts
The Blob Storage account is a specialized storage account used to store block blobs and append blobs. You can't store page blobs in these accounts, therefore you can't store VHD files. These accounts allow you to set an access tier to Hot or Cool; the tier can be changed at any time.

The hot access tier is used for files that are accessed frequently -- you pay a higher cost for storage, but the cost of accessing the blobs is much lower. For blobs stored in the cool access tier, you pay a higher cost for accessing the blobs, but the cost of storage is much lower.
