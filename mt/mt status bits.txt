mt status bits

The low-level tape control command mt has one inquiry form:

 mt -f /dev/nst0 status
The return from this command at CERN looks like this example:
SCSI 2 tape drive:
File number=0, block number=0, partition=0.
Tape block size 0 bytes. Density code 0x44 (no translation).
Soft error count since last status=0
General status bits on (41010000):
 BOT ONLINE IM_REP_EN
The 4 byte return of status bits, here 41010000 (leading zeros suppressed) contains the following 32 flags (not all bits have a known meaning to me). In this case the bytes have values 41, 01, 00 and 00. corresponding to the BOT, ONLINE and IM_REP_EN flags as listed below are set.

Note that these flags do not always seem to be cleared at tape unload time: they may it seems correspond to the status last time a cartridge was actually mounted!

Also, there are two status flags SM (which should be false after an 'mt seek n' go to block n command) and EOT (volume positioned at EOT, end of tape) which I have not been able to find evidence for. See for example here.

MSB (leftmost in this string) to LSB (rightmost in this string)

                  Meaning
  1  8  EOF       Tape is mounted and is positioned at EOF, end of file
  2  4  BOT       Tape is mounted and is positioned at BOT, beginning of tape (load point, before any VOL1/HDR or data)

  4  1  ?

  5  8  EOD       Tape is mounted and positioned at EOD, end of data (ie has been read to 'then end')
  6  4  WR_PROT   Tape is mounted and WRITE PROTECTED, normally a mechanical lock on the cartridge
  7  2  ?
  8  1  ONLINE    Tape is mounted and ONLINE (effectively a mounted cartridge is 'READY')
