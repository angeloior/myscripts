Files to back up before upgrading, migrating, or uninstalling the OfficeScan server

OfficeScan server backup procedure:

Create a backup of the OfficeScan server database to a location other than the OfficeScan program directory. The OfficeScan server can be set to automatically back up client/agent database information.

This is configurable via the web-based management console under Administration > Database Backup section.  This process copies all database files under ..\TrendMicro\OfficeScan\PCCSRV\HTTPDB to either a local or remote location.

It is recommended to do a daily backup especially during client/agent deployment.  The schedule can be changed to weekly after the deployment is complete.

It is also recommended to configure the backup to start at 2:00 AM when client/agent interaction is minimal and the process does not coincide with other OfficeScan scheduled tasks.

 
Do not use any other type of back up tool or application. Using third party application to back up the database may cause system instability or database corruption.
Stop the OfficeScan Master Service.
Manually back up the OfficeScan Server and Firewall configuration files:
..\PCCSRV\Ofcscan.ini – Server configuration information
..\PCCSRV\ Private\Ofcserver.ini – Server and Update Source configuration
..\PCCSRV\ Ous.ini – client/agent update source configuration
..\PCCSRV\ Private\PFW folder – Firewall profiles / policies
..\PCCSRV\ Private\SortingRuleStore\ SortingRule.xml
..\PCCSRV\ Private\AuthorStore folder – RBA User Profile
..\PCCSRV\ Private\vdi.ini – vdi settings
Start the OfficeScan Master Service.
Perform the uninstallation/upgrade or migration.
For details, see Uninstalling the OfficeScan server or Installing or Upgrading the OfficeScan Server in the Installation Guide.
Restoring the OfficeScan Server

In the event of server corruption, the OfficeScan server can be restored using the following steps:

 
You can only restore the OfficeScan server by using the same host name, FQDN, IP address, and installation path of the old or corrupted server.
Rebuild the server using the same host name, FQDN, and IP address.
Install OfficeScan 10.6 Server with the same Service Pack and Patch level as the original server.
You can verify this information by checking the version details of the Ofcservice.exe from the old server.
Stop the OfficeScan Master Service and WWW Publishing Service.
Restore the backup database files under ..\Trend Micro\OfficeScan\PCCSRV\HTTPDB directory.
Restore the OfficeScan server and Firewall policy configurations:

..\PCCSRV\ Private\Ofcserver.ini
..\PCCSRV\ Ous.ini
..\PCCSRV\ Private\PFW folder
..\PCCSRV\ Private\SortingRuleStore\SortingRule.xml
..\PCCSRV\ Private\AuthorStore folder
..\PCCSRV\ Private\vdi.ini
From the command prompt, go to ..\Trend Micro\ OfficeScan folder and run the command "svrsvcsetup.exe –setprivilege".
