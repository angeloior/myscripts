Restoring the OfficeScan Server backup and configuration files

SUMMARY
Restore the database and configuration file backup of your OfficeScan server.
Note: The following solution assumes that the OfficeScan server is being restored to the same host machine with the same FQDN and IP address, and will use the existing OfficeScan SQL database.
DETAILS
To restore the database:
Stop the following services:
OfficeScan Master Service
WWW Publishing Service
Verify the current database engine type.
Go to ..\PCCSRV\Private\Ofcserver.ini.
Look for the value of DBE_ENGINE:
[INI_DBE_ENGINE_SECTION]
CodeBase: DBE_ENGINE=1001 
SQL Server: DBE_ENGINE=1002
Note: The OfficeScan server uses CodeBase by default.
Back up and restore the database by doing one of the following:
For CodeBase, restore the backup database files under . .\PCCSRV\HTTPDB.
For SQL Server, no additional steps required.
