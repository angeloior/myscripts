#CPU

       -u     Report CPU utilization. The following values are displayed:

              %user
                     Percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while execut-
                     ing at the user level (application).

              %nice
                     Percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while execut-
                     ing at the user level with nice priority.

              %system
                     Percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while execut-
                     ing at the system level (kernel).

              %iowait
                     Percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs were idle  during
                     which the system had an outstanding disk I/O request.

              %idle
                     Percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs were idle and the
                     system did not have an outstanding disk I/O request.

#processes
-c     Report process creation activity.
proc/s

#contexts
-w     Report system switching activity.
cswch/s Total number of context switches per second.

#interrupts
?

#swapping
-W     Report swapping statistics. The following values are displayed:
pswpin/s Total number of swap pages the system brought in per second
pswpout/s Total  number  of  swap  pages the system brought out per second.

#paging activity

              pgpgin/s
                     Total number of kilobytes the system paged in  from  disk
                     per second.

              pgpgout/s
                     Total  number  of  kilobytes the system paged out to disk
                     per second.

                     Number of page faults (major + minor) made by the  system
                     per  second (post 2.5 kernels only).  This is not a count
                     of page faults  that  generate  I/O,  because  some  page
                     faults can be resolved without I/O.

              majflt/s
                     Number  of  major  faults the system has made per second,
                     those which have required loading a memory page from disk
                     (post 2.5 kernels only).

#I/O
 -b     Report I/O and transfer rate statistics. This option works  only with  kernels  older  than  2.5.   The following values are displayed:
bread/s
bwrtn/s

#Page
-R     Report memory statistics. The following values are displayed:
frmpg/s
Number of memory pages freed by the system per second.  A
negative  value represents a number of pages allocated by
the system.  Note that a page has a size of 4 kB or 8  kB
according to the machine architecture.
bufpg/s
Number  of additional memory pages used as buffers by the
system per second.  A negative value  means  fewer  pages
used as buffers by the system.
campg/s
Number  of  additional  memory pages cached by the system
per second.  A negative value means fewer  pages  in  the cache.

#Memory Usage
      -r     Report memory and swap space utilization statistics.   The  fol-
              lowing values are displayed:

              kbmemfree
                     Amount of free memory available in kilobytes.

              kbmemused
                     Amount  of  used  memory in kilobytes. This does not take
                     into account memory used by the kernel itself.

              %memused
                     Percentage of used memory.

#Memory Misc
            kbbuffers
                     Amount of memory used as buffers by the kernel  in  kilo-
                     bytes.

              kbcached
                     Amount  of  memory  used  to  cache data by the kernel in
                     kilobytes.


#Swap Usage
kbswpfree
                     Amount of free swap space in kilobytes.

              kbswpused
                     Amount of used swap space in kilobytes.

              %swpused
                     Percentage of used swap space.

              kbswpcad
                     Amount of cached swap memory in kilobytes.  This is  mem-
                     ory  that  once  was  swapped out, is swapped back in but
                     still also is in the swap area (if memory  is  needed  it
                     doesn’t  need  to  be  swapped  out  again  because it is
                     already in the swap area. This saves I/O).


#Load
-q     Report queue length and load averages. The following values  are
              displayed:

              runq-sz
                     Run  queue  length  (number  of processes waiting for run
                     time).

              plist-sz
                     Number of processes in the process list.

              ldavg-1
                     System load average for the last minute.

              ldavg-5
                     System load average for the past 5 minutes.

              ldavg-15
                     System load average for the past 15 minutes.



#Disk
       -d     Report  activity  for  each  block device (kernels 2.4 and newer
              only).  When data is displayed, the device specification dev m-n
              is  generally  used ( DEV column).  m is the major number of the
              device.  With recent kernels (post 2.5), n is the  minor  number
              of  the  device, but is only a sequence number with pre 2.5 ker-
              nels.

              txdrop/s
                     Number  of transmitted packets dropped per second because
